Grabs get around risk of witch time so using your grab to lead into kill confirms is very optimal.If Bayonetta dairs onto stage and you shield it you can grab her, her entire leg is a hurt box which allows you to grab from further distances than the center of the attack. [against ABK] the best option is to actually air dodge like short hop air dodge that way you can actually punish her landing. pika doesn't seem to struggle against bayo, being so small lets you slip around her smash hitboxes even when witch timed and our biggest sin- spamming short hop fair- is actually pretty witch time-proof since you can just push forward and cancel it with the next active hitbox. You can punish with a JCUS before the second hit of her grounded Side-B comes out. Her nair lacks a hitbox below so you can punish her Bullet Arts Nair with a JCUS." , advantage : "When you get your combos started remember to never over extend, instead put a pause to bair out the with time so you can extend the combo a little longer or even getting a harder punish. When bayo has already spent a few witch time you can actually go for your up-smash so you can get your kills.

This is not even considering any of Corrin’s other moves- not even considering smash attacks (which a higher level Corrin shouldn’t do vs Pika in neutral), Corrin has all the options necessary to fend off Pika’s approaches. Summary: You can’t “hard approach” a good Corrin. However, Corrin can’t safely approach a higher level Pikachu either. Pikachu can maneuver himself around Corrin’s options very well, and punish most openings at various distances (yay for QA punishing end lag from beyond Corrin fsmash range). Summary: Bait out Corrin’s moves and know how to punish her. Don’t be aggressive in neutral especially if she’s standing there, and make sure you know her range- she’s not a fast character, and you can use all sorts of moves to wall her out as well if she rushes. **Note:  Aggressive = throwing out attacks unsafely or just madly rushing at her. Other tactics to pressure her, such as fading back thunderjolts or run up and shield (her grab sucks and you can sh nair away if doing the mixup properly, don’t rely on this though!), don’t count under this. Know your safe spacing around her range, stay near the ground as possible (as her aerial coverage is pretty good), beware of dragon lunge (especially at max range, run to shield near him/her is pretty decent as a mixup as you can sh nair the moment she pins through your shield if close enough), beware of her aerials and aerial combos (go for the ledge then reset to safe neutral). Know Corrin’s moves, and know that Corrin normal b (dragon fang shot) gets beat by thunderjolt at any charge level. Know how to punish dragon lunge/pin. Thunderjolt will put down a dragon lunge-happy Corrin, and if Corrin jumps or may jump be ready to run very close and shield if you really want to punish it bad otherwise. And if she kicks, know when the hitbox ends and when you should punish Corrin before her end lag ends (there’s a significant opening but it’s before her momentum ends) You can QA OoS after she has kicked to get a good punish. If Corrin does dragon fang shot (the b shot), know that you can punish her pretty well with QA or other options (albeit never approach from directly ahead, ie reaching only with QA2 starting along the ground, as the bite can be used pretty well)", advantage : "Watch ESAM’s video on how to gimp Corrin, and if you don’t have that opening or otherwise can’t gimp in other ways, be ready to cover the ledge options, which Pikachu can do very well (beware of acting too fast, as for example Corrin can jump away and spear the ledge if necessary). If he/she grabs ledge, still space Corrin and try to bait her or frame trap her landings. Also Corrin’s recovery is really telegraphed, it is one of the easiest Characters to land the Thunderbolt into Thunderspike Combo", disadvantage : "Don’t ever be above Corrin. Go for the ledge (or a platform/QAC) preferably, and reset to normal neutral", stage : "Don’t go to Town & City - Only real disadvantage here is the lower ceiling, which Corrin’s uair can use fairly well at times. BF and Lylat can go either way. Battlefield limits Corrin’s sh options a little, but versus Pikachu, it doesn’t change too much. Corrin can use the platforms to combo you if you land into them (as well as extend aerial combos if you’re above the stage and try to come back to the stage directly). Lylat - According to some Corrins, they like this stage due to platform layout and easy 2 frame if stage is tilted right. However, Pikachu can abuse the tilt at times to avoid many of Corrin’s neutral moves (including dragon lunge) as well as make Corrin’s life very hard when recovering. Flat stages let Corrin juggle well, but as long as you avoid that there's nothing special here." };

High Monkey flip can be stopped by F-air, and low Monkey Flip gives you the chance to hit him with an F-Smash (try to abuse that F-smash is really disjointed).When you have the banana you can camp Diddy pretty easily, also Diddy can’t commit to anything because you can toss the banana OoS and get a really good punish. Also you want to make notice of where he rolls after being tripped by the banana a good thing to do is to not punish one option (i.e, not punishing rolling towards you) most of the match to condition that option and get a free Up -smash at kill percent. Also you can have a lot of shenanigans with the banana so be sure to have your item game on point so you can punish and pull some monkey tricks.", disadvantage : "Diddy’s combo game isn’t that great, he can get 2 or 3 hits and you can land fairly easy if Diddy lacks the banana. When Diddy has the banana you are at disadvantage as you can’t really play neutral anymore because he can throw it to catch your spacing, if you hit his shield or simply for some stage control. Keep moving and be patient until you get a proper opening. If possible, steal the banana. Diddys offstage game isn’t really that strong against us, but his ledge game is. Watch out for ledge trumps as they can lead into a back air or even a d-air spike if you regrab the ledge. Also he can cover multiple options by having the banana on the ledge or near the ledge. If the banana is on the ledge you can let go and jump to steal it, be aware of your options and play calm and safe.", stage : "FD is a bad place for us because of the lack of platforms can hinder our mobility and can help Diddy put some solid ledge traps. Still doable but not recommended. Town and City is one of Diddy’s favorite stages, but is a double edged sword on both sides because both of us can kill really early. Dreamland enables some good mobility on Diddy, but it also does wonders for us. Battlefield enables you to survive longer, have mobility and also have a better chance to gimp Diddy. Lylat is really good for us and can hinder Diddy’s Monkey Flips. Finally, Sheikville doesn’t favour anyone that badly, so it is a great starter." };

CAN (using caps to make it different from the verb)  is for stage control and walling up our jolts while clay pigeon is a way to have a lasting projectile. Cowboy will usually be summoned when you are far away as it can cover a good distance and can condition you into shielding. This may lead into a grab, don’t worry, those lack any true follow ups and are only used for stage control / damage. Cowboys projectile has transcendent priority, so it won’t clash with jolt. You can hit him before he shoots to deny it but it is not that important. CAN is duck hunt best move in this MU as it can cover many options and may hinder our mobility. It can be shot on shield, recovery, grab, attacking, an taunt. Duck hunt has greater range than us, but has bad startup and end-lag. You might want to CQC but be patient as duck hunt can rack up damage deceivingly fast. Thunder Jolt is effective in stalling can and stopping Cowboy/ Clay Pidgeon but be wary of becoming too passive as this will allow DHD to approach and punish.", advantage : "If Duck Hunt summons cowboy near you, you can easily QA to punish (better to do it in the air to avoid the bullet) as it has lots of hit lag. If CAN is on the field, you can juggle Duck Hunt pretty easily with up airs, if CAN isn’t on the field he can mash B to summon it and stop the combo. Depending on % you can continue hitting Duck Hunt or he might actually start hitting you, the general rule is: If you are lower in % keep going as it is more likely that he will be above you, if you are on the even % you need a fast reaction to evaluate the situation and if you are on higher % you might better drop the combo. The safer way is to bait the CAN so you can punish better. When DH is offstage he lacks any hitbox so feel free to him as much as you want. If DH has already used his second jump you can hit him out of his Up-B and Bair-Drag him down. His recovery isn’t that good so he won’t be able to come back.

Mix your di to mess with his spacing and remember to try to tech everytime even outside of footstool, sometimes the animation last’s long enough for you to tech. The better you can outneutral him the less you will have to deal with massive damage. After about 80 %, he doesn’t really get much of off grabs. His uthrow and dthrow only does 5 %, You can DI away on dthrow > fair, and will usually avoid the kill confirm. Uthrow doesn’t have a 50-50 anymore and it won’t kill until 150 %.

There are 3 reasons for this: 1) Jigglypuff has horrible running speed, making it hard to punish the long range of fsmash. 2) Jigglypuff has poor range. 3) Jigglypuff is very light so it dies early. However, keep in mind that spamming it in neutral will make it stale, and thus not as good for killing. So, one option is to save it and only use it when jigglypuff is at high enough percentage for a kill. Pika probably has the advantage in neutral game, but since both Characters are going to rely on reads or unsafe setups, Puff probably edges out Pika in punish game simply because she can end stocks so early off of a good read. Again, Pika can play the runaway game and Puff has a hard time catching it. You won’t beat Puff in the air but you will  on the ground and you have good anti airs, us them", neutral : "Quick attack and Pika’s aerials are pretty bad in the MU, as Puff has plenty of options to stuff these options. Nair is a strong, long lasting aerial that will always beat out quick attack, and Puff gets trades against Pika’s Fairs and other aerials, and they will generally favor Puff rather than Pika, since her aerials tend to hit harder. RAR Up air is great as you can harras Puff pretty well from below and it is a good disjointed move. Because of this, Pika is better off playing a more grounded playstyle, trying to keep Puff out with anti-airs such as Utilt or Dsmash. Do keep in mind Puff’s dash attack is very good, having the same properties as Meta-Knights, but it’s not safe on shield. Watch out for this as Puff’s dash attack can be a very strong move. The neutral often becomes a rock paper scissors war, Puff’s Aerials beat Pika’s Aerials, Pika’s Anti-airs beat Puff’s aerials, Puff’s dash attack beats Pika’s anti airs, and so on. Both characters have solid answers to the other’s toolkit. Remember Pika has a better range on the ground so you can shut off Puffs grounded approaches pretty easily. Up air is the only aerial that can outrange Jigglypuff (from below). Buffered down air can trade with some of Puffs aerials if you want to go for the trade game as Puff can die earlier than Pika. Beware of Puff’s lingering hitboxes. If you are feeling confident you can trade your own Up-Smash with Puff’s aerials to kill puff in neutral", advantage : "Don’t overextend, know when your combos are true and when they’re not, if you overextend you might end up getting rested.(For example, Pika’s Dthrow -> Upair -> Fair isn’t true on Puff, you only get the Uair, if you go for a fair, you’re going to get rested.) Pika doesn’t have many strong combos on Jigglypuff, so he mostly relies on Pokes in neutral until he gets Puff to a percent where an Usmash or Fsmash read will KO. Gimping Puff is fairly difficult and will probably not happen often, but your best bet is catching Jigglypuff off guard with a Footstool. Also a Babysit edgeguard using your presence to keep Puff offstage) might force Puff to burn her jumps. A dragdown bair does the work in here. Your best bet at gimping Puff is to force her to keep on the air and try to bair drag her. Other options are footstools, but because of Puffs great air mobility it is a hard task. If Puff is at % and you are in a “safe” you can trade your up smash with Puff’s aerials to get the kill. It’s better to ledge guard Puff than to edgeguard her. If she uses side-b to latch into the stage you can have a free f-smash on her.", disadvantage : "The same is true for Jigglypuff, her combos do not work effectively on Pikachu, since he’s such a small character with such a strong recovery, she can’t get much going on him and will also have to rely on Pokes until she can get a Nair, Bair, or Rest read. Do keep in mind Puff can KO you as early as 30% if you do a bad roll or ledge get up with rest, so be very careful about any habits you may have. Mix up your recovery well, it’s unlikely Puff will get a KO off of an edgeguard situation, but you’re going to want to minimize the damage you take. At low % DI always away from Puff as she can true combo to soft Nair into Rest if you are not careful", stage : "FD seems pretty good against Jiggly because she actually needs to land on the stage to regain her jumps, meaning you can hunt her down.From the other stages no one gets too much of an advantage as both gain mobility.

Bomb has a fuse length of 4 seconds approximately. His killing moves are fair, dair, up air, smashes, tilts and up-b.", neutral : "Link gets a lot of his damage and kill options from punishes. He’ll use projectiles to force you to approach and then punish any mistakes you make. Take the game calmly and you should be fine. Be careful of his bombs and tether and how they change the dynamic of safe approaches. His bomb is not always active and certain movies like fair on shield will be safer without the bomb in hand than if it was present. Lot's of Bombs, Nair, Fair, Boomerang, Z-air, Wavebounce and B-reverse arrows are coming towards Pikachu in a hope of keeping him away. Pikachu can do his work on spamming too, but remember Jolt, cancels boomerang and arrow but it is beaten by bomb. We can have two approaches that work pretty well: an easy steady approach or the neutral breaking QA. Try to use a mix of both accordingly of what you see on your opponent. The easy steady approach usually works well in most scenarios, but the payload is not as big as a mid % (30 onwards) QA.  Your best shot (in my opinion) is to watch out carefully and go in with QA as Link pulls of a bomb, that is the time where it is most vulnerable and you can get the most of it. If you fail to catch Link while pulling a jump here's the time to approach a tad more carefully, especially if you notice that the Link has some bomb tech like instant drop, bomb fake, instant throw and auto canceled dair. Finally, remember that Nair, Up-air, D-air and F-air can beat our QA because the first three linger and the last comes with two hits. Link gets combos from Boomerang and Bombs, a two hit combo at most (just please reset neutral then and don't DI into boomerang into boomerang, into boomerang ... into boomerang). Keep always in movement and try not to get grabbed as Link can down throw into up tilt and most of his aerials to low-mid percents. Watch out for Jab, jab, grab; jab jab down smash, jab jab down tilt (doesn't work if you DI up and away on the jabs and jump away). Air ground, we actually need to be patient here, a well placed up-tilt or up smash can be really bad for us- Link can land with Nair, Fair or the For Glory Down Air (but be catious if Link knows how to cancel the last one)", advantage : "Bomb downward and D-air are about the only moves Link has to escape from a juggle situation so he can be kept in the air for good periods of time. His dair also doesn’t cover him completely as the hitbox is a little narrow so you can still hit him on the sides to launch him back in the air. Link’s Up-B recovery move is vulnerable from above so you can beat it out with a drag down B-air or a D-air if you wanted. Be ready to snatch his second jump. In this way you don’t have to go the long way in damaging him and sealing a stock but you can have your combos lead into a really easy edgeguard. Go and do the usual Pika stuff. Link's fastest move is Nair (frame 6) so if you feel", disadvantage : "We are at this when Link catches us with an Up-Tilt or grabs us as he can rack damage pretty well. At higher percents we only need to be cautious of his killing options so it is not that bad as they are easily avoided. I think Link's most dangerous punish is if we miss Up-throw thunder as if he manage to air dodge he can fastfall down air and kill us at high percents. Watch out when landing, if you feel uneasy QA away. Finally, never NEVER never air dodge his downthrow if you air dodge he can up air (the lingering hitbox maintains), short hop fast fall and charge an smash and Link kills pretty earlier with that. The most optimal way is to jump again and land safely after and be wary of the double jump up-b (we can punish that because it is not a true combo if we jump away). Link has a really bad time edgeguarding us. His best bet is to Z-Drop a bomb or try to intercept our QA with a lasting move, but because of Link's poor air speed we can easily avoid that. We can also go real low to be safe and if he gets greedy we can thunderspike him if we still have our jump. Fair can come from a double jab and he reads the jump away, down smash cames from the double jab and no jumping. F-.smash comes from down throw and Pika air dodging in front of him, the same as up.smash. and up air. Up b can true combo from bomb if he is near you (but not fair or up air). or OoS if you hit his shield (risky though) And the tilts can con from random, the good thing is that most of this things aren't true and too slow to actually be harmful", stage : "Lylat as always is a good choice for pikachu. Gives you more places to QAC so your approaches can be made safer and less punishable. With the tilt of lylat link may also be more inclined to rely on tether to recover instead of risking Up-B hitting the bottom of the stage and if you read his recoveries you can punish them. The platforms give you another plane to travel along to help avoid his projectile wall and to build an upwards string. Also his laggy landing options can be punished from underneath the platforms while you remain safe from their effects due to your size." };

Little Mac has a good amount of KO potential with his KO punch and strong smashes. Little Mac can easily and very early take a stock from pikachu due to his light weight.

Use your air mobility to move around him, his frame data is really good so don’t do anything laggy. His PP-U-tilt is a great approaching tool and combo starter, be wary of that. Do not let him land a D-tilt it can be lethal. Jolt camping doesn’t work that great (unless you are in a platform he can’t reach).  Do not try to challenge or punish Little Mac’s smash attacks. They have super armor. A grab will get through his super armor and could be effective but otherwise it’s dangerous as they have a relatively short amount of lag and come out quickly meaning it can almost bait you in for a punish of his own. A throw at high percents off the stage even if it doesn’t outright kill him will usually be the stock due to Little Mac’s poor recovery. Little Mac lacks good options to deal with projectiles such as thunder jolts aside from using his fast speed to try to rush in. This means thunder jolts when used safely and intelligently can apply pressure and damage and also force Little Mac to approach you. His most dangerous option in regards to handling projectiles would be his Jolt Haymaker which will go over them and is a relatively quick move so make sure you’re spaced properly so he cannot reach you as you’re launching a thunder jolt. A wiffed Jolt Haymaker is punishable though. Little Mac can also use the super armor of his smashes to power through a thunderjolt and if you have a habit of running in after your thunder jolts as a way to approach he may use this option as a mix up to strike you as you near him. He can jump over jolts which leaves him vulnerable to your fast aerials. He can try to counter a close range jolt but otherwise counter is a sub-par and unlikely choice to see Little Mac use as it puts him in a very punishable state. Spacing is very important when in close quarters combat with Little Mac. A few of his smash attacks such F-tilt or F-smash move him forward a step so be careful with whiffing attacks anywhere near him. Little Mac can space people out with D-tilt, F-tilt, and F-smash. Anti-air moves from Little Mac include U-tilt, U-smash, and up-angled F-smash.His dash attack is not safe on shield so it should be a free OoS punish for you if he attempts one. He can link a KO punch from a D-tilt between 30-90% and KO punch is unblockable so do not stand in shield thinking you are safe from it. Beware of making a habit of being straight above Little Mac- his up b is faster than you think and hard to react to if you’re not careful", advantage : "We can combo Little Mac pretty well, bait out his counter to extend your combos.Good Little Macs will save their jump while being edge guarded so don’t be that reckless. Think about what is the best way to punish Mac. Do your combos not looking for the damage, instead get stage control by putting him offstage. Platform camp if needed. Little Mac has low air speed, short jumps, and bad aerial options with a recovery that doesn’t snap. Take advantage of this. If you grab Little Mac try to throw him off stage rather than juggling him or taking some of the other options available to you. A huge advantage Pikachu has against Little Mac is gimping him- Little Mac has very few options off stage to recover so learn to pressure and gimp him", disadvantage : "Do not try to land on Little Mac. You do not want to challenge his up-smash and Little Mac is fast enough to catch your landing. QA away from him if you need to and use attacks for spacing if necessary but try not to rely on them as a way to recover from being juggled. If Mac Lands a D-Tilt never air dodge, you will get smashed. Better jump away from him and use platforms to land. He have some Kill setups with D-tilt. KO Punch at low percents, Up-B at high Percents. Jab can also combo into Up-B at decent percents and an air dodge read come with a sweet spotted Up - Smash. If Mac hits your shield with D-tilt be patient and use jump OoS to get into a safe place. Keeping shield might lead to F-smashed angled down (that breaks sheilds).

You can camp on Duck Hunt by taking lead and heading into the tree as Little Mac will struggle to safely reach you but just remember that Little Mac could also run away with the lead initially due to the flat nature of Duck Hunt and his excellent ground game. This is also possible to a point on Battlefield and Dreamland as Little Mac will have an extremely hard time punishing you when you’re being careful and moving between platforms- however, make sure not to get cocky while on platforms as his up b is fast" };
