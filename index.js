Don’t be too predictable or commit to punishable options in neutral and you should be okay. Pikachu has the speed to float around him while not getting grabbed or punished, still you have to respect Bowser’s space. Killing Bowser as early as possible is also vital because of how much rage helps him in this matchup.", neutral : "Be wary about approaching a shielding Bowser. Whirling Fortress is a very strong OoS option, and Bowser has excellent grab range and potentially deadly follow-ups out of up throw. Forward and back throw can kill by themselves near the ledge. Bowser takes no hitstun from jab’s weak hitbox until around 35% or so, allowing him easy punishes at this spacing until he takes a bit more damage. Jab’s stronger hitbox will cause hitstun starting at 9%. (Staling and rage are not accounted for)", advantage : "Bowser’s size and frame data make it EXTREMELY difficult for him to return to neutral once he gets hit, especially when he’s in the air. Do not be shy about aggressive juggles and extensions after you win neutral. Dair is very good off stage against Bowser’s recovery, especially when challenging it from above. Double-jump nair from underneath is a good option but much harder to pull off.", disadvantage : "SDI up on uthrow > nair. Going for the ledge is usually a solid option, but mix up your ledge get-ups to avoid hard punishes. Also watch out o his D-tilt that can 2-frame hit you because of the big hitbox.

His PK fire auto spaces kind of like a wave bounce. Hi has better disjoints than Pikachu and overall decent frame data. He is full of 50/50’s. Both characters can combo each other pretty well. The matchup is on favor on whoever gets a decent lead first as both can combo you pretty hard", neutral : "Approaching Lucas is not that easy as it seems. Wavebounce PK Fire is super annoying to deal with and it covers pretty much all of our approach options adding that it is super safe. Power shielding and closing the distance is a good idea but beware of dash grab and pivot grabs. Lucas get’s his stuff going because he abuses of unsafe approaches, dont’ take the bait on trying to rush him out, being patient is key in this MU. Quick attack is a good tool for a surprise attack to catch his landings or you are close enough after power shielding a PK Fire. NEVER do a QA in straight line because Lucas can grab those pretty easily. The 7 is safer and it is easier to connect and lead into more stuff. Camping Lucas is pretty much the best option as Lucas can’t catch Pika if we decide to run. Remember not to use jolt unless it’s necessaryHitting Lucas shields means you will get grabbed, or d.tilt grab. Do not hit his shield. Baiting his grab is one of the most important thing in this MU. It is fairly fast and recovers well, so if you jumped over it, tomahawk as it is hard to get a landing fair. This works for getting a lead and killing Lucas", advantage : "Lucas is fairly easy to combo because he lacks a fast combobreaker, still he can stall his landing with PSI Magnet, so be wary of those. After you hit your strings fastfall and try to keep him in the air as long and safe as you can, getting and extending your lead is crucial in this MU. When you get a decent lead run away. You force Lucas to commit mistakes and approach so you can punish harder. Cause Lucas is floaty getting a jablock is harder. Also our d-tilt get’s outrange by grab so it’s not that good of an option. Baiting a grab into Up-Smash it’s a nice kill strategy. Also RAR Thunder works. Lucas is harder to gimp than Ness cause his tether recovery and his PKT reaches farther.  You can cover tether recovery by using a drop zone bair or thunderwalling. It’s easy to challenge PKT2 with fast fall dair. Lucas PKT1 is practically impossible to destroy but it is super slow. You have the time to hit Lucas out of it with proper spacing (remember to hit from the side instead of above). Lucas landing options are pretty much nair and in some cases dair. Nair is a little harder to punish but still possible, remember to extend your lead as much as you can and be safe.", disadvantage : "Lucas has a great combo game but it mostly relies on 50/50’s. Lucas main game is to get a down throw follow up. Here are the ways he can get a grab: Falling nair, dtilt, conditioning into shield with PK Fire, zair, pivot and raw grabs. Watch out for this options and don’t hit Lucas shield. Once when you get grabbed mix your DI, it has true follow ups on either one but he first has to read the DI or have insanely good reaction time. At lower percents he can get a chain of nairs into regrab or if hi gets fancy a mixup with back ir into regrab. Again, once he hits you with a nair mix up your DI again to escape the follow up. Also you can SDI out ouf Luca’s nair. At 100’sih percents it is a 50/50 again with an up air depending on your DI. RAR back air might work on the ledge so be wary of that. Once you get out of his strings QA’ing into safety is probably the better option as Lucas can’t really chase you. Never land on Lucas unless you want to get his combos reseted.Remember not to blindlessly QA as his Up.Smash is huge and powerful."};
